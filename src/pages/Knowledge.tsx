                Perfume is a solution composed of volatile fragrance oils,
                aromatic compounds, alcohol, and water, typically formulated by
                a perfumer. A neurosensory psychologist, who is a consultant in
                the fragrance industry, states that the molecules of scent must
                be small enough and light enough to float in the air. The
                crucial cells for scent perception are the olfactory receptor
                cells located within the nasal cavity. When air flows through
                the nose, scent molecules interact with the olfactory receptor
                cells embedded in the upper lining tissue of the nasal cavity.
                These receptor cells, known as ciliated sensory neurons, capture
                the scent molecules that enter through the nasal passage. When
                there is interaction between the scent molecules and the
                ciliated sensory neurons, it triggers changes in electrical
                potentials within the olfactory receptor cells, stimulating the
                transmission of nerve impulses to the brain for interpretation
                of the received scent.

                In reality, perfumes are designed to have three layers of scent,
                with each layer gradually revealing its aroma at different
                times. In the fragrance industry, there is a term used to
                describe the harmonious blending of scents, known as 'notes'.
                The combination of these scents leads to a unique identity.
                Users initially experience the top notes within the first 15
                minutes of applying the perfume. The molecules of the scents in
                this layer quickly evaporate and fade away. Perfume designers
                often use prominent scents in this layer to capture attention.
                Following the top notes, the heart notes emerge and linger for
                approximately 3-4 hours. These scents are the main essence of
                the perfume that makes it memorable. Lastly, the base notes are
                scents that support the overall fragrance. They are typically
                composed of molecules that evaporate slowly, allowing the scent
                to last throughout the day.

                This is an example of the characteristics of molecules that help
                enhance understanding of the evaporation process of perfumes in
                all three layers. Evaporation is a process where a liquid
                changes into a gas, with intermolecular forces being one of the
                significant factors affecting this process. Molecules with
                stronger bonds tend to form larger molecules that evaporate more
                slowly. This is a reason why the scent of perfume changes
                throughout the day.

                Furthermore, if you observe perfume bottles, you will notice
                French phrases indicating different levels of fragrance
                concentration. The concentration levels signify the intensity of
                the perfume, which can be categorized into three levels.
